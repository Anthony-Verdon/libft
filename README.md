# Libft

## My own library of C functions

This project is the first one of the 42 common core. The goal is to create and reproduce differents functions to use them in our future projects. You will find the subject of the project into the repository. My grade : 122/100.

## How to use it

1. Clone it `git clone git@github.com:AnthonyVerdon-42Projects/libft.git`.
2. Compile it `make`. You can also use `make bonus` to compile linked list functions.
3. In your project, compile with `-Llibft -lft` and include `libft.h` in your file. If you want to put them in another directory, you must compile with `-L{path}/libft` and include `{path}/libft.h`.
4. Use it like you need ! If you need to know which functions you can use or what are their behavior, check the subject in the repository.

## How to modify it

If you want to modify it, it's really simple, you just need to add your files into the source of the Makefile and add the prototypes of the functions into `libft.h`
